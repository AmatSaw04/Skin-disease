Skin Disease Analysis using Machine Learning 🔹 Introduction Skin diseases are among the most common medical conditions worldwide, affecting millions of people. Early detection and classification of skin diseases can significantly improve treatment outcomes. With advancements in Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Machine Learning models can now classify skin diseases with high accuracy using medical image datasets like HAM10000.

🔹 Skin Disease Categories in HAM10000 The HAM10000 dataset (Human Against Machine with 10000 training images) contains images of 7 common skin diseases:

1️⃣ Actinic Keratoses (AKIEC) – Pre-cancerous, scaly skin patches caused by sun damage. 2️⃣ Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) – A common type of skin cancer with slow growth. 3️⃣ Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL) – Non-cancerous skin growths such as seborrheic keratosis. 4️⃣ Dermatofibroma (DF) – A harmless, firm skin nodule. 5️⃣ Melanoma (MEL) – A deadly form of skin cancer, requiring early detection. 6️⃣ Nevus (NV) – Common moles, usually harmless but sometimes evolving into melanoma. 7️⃣ Vascular Lesions (VASC) – Blood vessel-related skin conditions like hemangiomas.

🔹 Machine Learning Approach The Skin Disease Analyzer uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the HAM10000 dataset to classify images into these 7 categories. The model architecture may include: ✅ Feature Extraction using a pre-trained CNN (ResNet50) ✅ Fine-Tuning the model on HAM10000 dataset ✅ Data Augmentation to improve generalization ✅ Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

🔹 Expected Outcomes 🔹 Automated Diagnosis: The model assists dermatologists in early detection. 🔹 Improved Accuracy: Deep learning reduces human errors in classification. 🔹 Faster Processing: Quick diagnosis compared to manual examination.

🚀 Future Scope 🔸 Deploying the model via Flask/FastAPI for real-world usage. 🔸 Improving classification accuracy using advanced architectures like Vision Transformers (ViTs). 🔸 Extending the dataset for better generalization across different skin tones.
